This attempts to fix MC-237017, a bug that fills all caves below -54 with lava. With this mod, the lava level is tied to the bedrock level instead of being hardcoded, making it possible to generate caves hundreds of blocks deep.

This has no real use if you don't use a datapack or other means of deepening your world below -64!

Supposed to be used with my datapack that expands the world from 640 to -512: -COMING SOON-

This is a direct forge port of https://github.com/Andrew6rant/MC-237017-Fix
